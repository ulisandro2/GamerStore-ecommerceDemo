Welcome to GamerStore, a React E-commerce Demo, and my final project for the CoderHouse React course. This project represents the culmination of my FullStack journey, taking the original CoderHouse React application and enhancing it with a backend implementation. This involved a deep dive into new technologies, including MercadoPago Developers for payment processing, resulting in a cleaner and more practical frontend design.

## Project Overview

- **Frontend:** React, Styled Components, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express

- **Payment Gateway:** MercadoPago Developers

## Project Highlights

- Showcase of React proficiency through a user-friendly e-commerce demo.
- Integration of MercadoPago Developers for secure and reliable payment processing.
- Optimized frontend design for a clean and practical user experience.
